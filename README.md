# YouTube Comment Sentiment Analysis

This project is a web application that performs sentiment analysis on comments from a given YouTube video. The application scrapes comments using the YouTube Data API and analyzes their sentiments using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The results are displayed on a simple web interface built with Flask.

Detailed Overview
Web Scraping
The web scraping component uses the YouTube Data API to fetch comments from a specific YouTube video. This method is preferred over traditional web scraping as it is more reliable and adheres to YouTube's usage policies. The script fetches comments in batches, handling pagination to retrieve up to 100 comments per request until all comments are fetched.

Sentiment Analysis
The sentiment analysis is performed using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool, which is well-suited for social media text. VADER provides a set of lexical features and combines them with grammatical and syntactical rules to assign a sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral) to each comment.

Web Interface
The web interface is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It consists of two main pages:

Index Page (index.html): A simple form where users can input the URL of a YouTube video.
Results Page (results.html): Displays the sentiment analysis results, including the number of positive, neutral, and negative comments.
Future Scope
There are several potential improvements and extensions that can be made to this project:

Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Integrate more sophisticated NLP models such as BERT, RoBERTa, or GPT for more accurate sentiment analysis.
Language Support: Extend the sentiment analysis to support multiple languages.
Comment Filtering: Implement functionality to filter comments based on criteria like date, likes, or replies.
Visualization: Add graphical representations of the sentiment analysis results, such as pie charts or bar graphs, for better insights.
Real-time Analysis: Implement real-time sentiment analysis for live streams or newly posted comments.
Deployment: Deploy the application on a cloud platform like AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud for broader accessibility.
User Authentication: Add user authentication and allow users to save and track their sentiment analysis history.
